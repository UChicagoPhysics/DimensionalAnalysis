# Dimensional Analysis

This course covers concepts and techniques of dimensional analysis applied to problems across physics. Topics include the identification of relevant and irrelevant variables, the use of symmetry, and some aspects of intermediate asymptotics. Students will learn to use Buckingham's pi theorem, evaluate scaling relationships, and quantitatively analyze systems from sand dunes to cosmological structures. The goals of this course include the development of problem solving skills using basic principles, cultivation of physical intuition for complex dynamics, and simple mathematical modelling.
